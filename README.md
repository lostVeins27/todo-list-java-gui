# todo-list-java-gui
A Java-based todo-list application with the use of Swing GUI and have local storage saving feature.

## Features
- **Add Task**: This is the function of a button that opens a window when the 'ADD TASK' button is pressed. In that window, you will be able to add your task.
- **Archive Task**: Inside the 'File' menu, we have implemented an 'Archived Tasks' feature to save your finished tasks. You can also select and delete archived tasks there.
- **Clear All**: This will clear all tasks if the user wants to reset them.
- **Local Storage Save**: This feature allows saving tasks in the user's local storage (`user/Documents/ToDoList Archive`), so they will carry over and remain available whenever you close and reopen the application.

1. Clone the repository or download the file from the release.
2. Go inside the `src/main` folder,
3. And run `ToDoMain.java` with your preferred **Java IDE** (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
